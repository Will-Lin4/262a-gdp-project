LIBEP: Enhanced Portability Library

Copyright (c) 2008-2014, Eric P. Allman.  All rights reserved.

LIBEP is a library I wrote initially to explore some ideas with the
intent of changing some of the low-level code in sendmail.  That
never happened, but I decided to release this library anyway in the
hopes that others may find it useful or informative.

The layout of this directory is as follows:

    LICENSE	The license (it's a BSD license).
    README	This file.
    benchmark	Some performance benchmarks from a while back,
		including some results.
    conf	Contains ep_conf.h for various platforms.  The
		default version (in src) should work though, so
		this is basically redundant.
    doc		Some documentation.  The main file is
		Libep-Notes.dbk, which is the docbook source
		for the primary documentation.  There should
		also be an HTML version in Libep-Notes.html.
    src		The source code.  On common platforms (i.e., those
		that I have tested) compiling this should just be
		a matter of typing "make".
    test	Some test scripts for basic functionality.  There
		should be a great deal more, but these test all
		of the important subsystems.

I've done a blog posting about the library as well, which includes
an assessment of what I thing works well, works sort of, and doesn't
work well.  My blog is at http://www.neophilic.com/blogs/eric.php.
