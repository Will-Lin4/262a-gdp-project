.Sh NAME
.Nm gdp-log-view
.Nd view information about an on-disk GDP log
.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar log-root-dir
.Op Fl D Ar debug-spec
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl v
.Op Ar log-name ...
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
scans GDP log files and prints information about them.
It can only be run on the servers on which logs are actually stored,
i.e., this is a very low level diagnostic and debugging tool.
However, it does not attempt to assess log integrity and consistency;
for that, see
.Xr gdp-log-check 8 .
.Pp
If the
.Fl l
flag is given,
information about all logs hosted on the server is printed
and no names may be listed on the command line.
Otherwise, at least one name must be listed on the command line.
.Pp
The amount and content of the output is driven by the
.Fl v
flag.
If not set, only the names of matching logs
(that is, the base-64 encoded printable version of the internal log names)
are printed.
The
.Fl v
flag may be repeated to get additional verbosity.
If any
.Fl v
flags are given, the output is multiple lines per log.
.Pp
Details of the output format (other than with no
.Fl v
flags given) are subject to change.

.Sh OPTIONS
.
.Bl -tag
.
.It Fl d Ar log-root-dir
Sets the root of the tree that stores the GDP log files.
Defaults to the value of the
.Va swarm.gdplogd.gcl.dir
runtime parameter.
.
.It Fl D Ar debug-spec
Turns on debugging flags using the libep-style format.
Useful only with the code in hand.
.
.It Fl l
List all local logs,
somewhat like the
.Xr ls 1
system command.
By default this is just the printable versions of the internal names,
but is modified by the
.Fl v
flag.
.
.It Fl v
Prints the log name,
the number of records in the log,
and the external human-oriented name of the log (if any).
This format is intended to be machine parsable.
.
.It Fl vv
Prints the log name,
the number of records,
and a summary of the standard
.Qq "built in"

Creation Time,
and
Creator.
.
.It Fl vvv
As with
.Fl vv ,
but includes all metadata information.
.
.It Fl vvvv

and the record metadata (record number, length, timestamp, and signature).

Includes the content of all records.
