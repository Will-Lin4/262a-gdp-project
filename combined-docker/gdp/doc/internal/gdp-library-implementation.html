    <h1>Global Data Plane Library Implementation</h1>
    Eric Allman<br>
    2015-02-26<br>
    <br>
    <p class="metanotes">This document is not yet complete.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>This document describes the internals of the Global Data Plane (GDP)
      run-time library at a conceptual level.&nbsp; This library is linked into
      any client that wishes to participate in the Global Data Plane.&nbsp; The
      base library is implemented in C, which is what this document will assume,
      but bindings for the external interfaces are available for other
      languages.&nbsp; See the document Global Data Plane Programmatic API for
      details of that interface.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p class="metanotes">To be completed.</p>
    <p> Main modules: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>API.</li>
      <li>Request management.</li>
      <li>Datum management.<br>
      </li>
      <li>I/O buffering.</li>
      <li>GOB associative cache.</li>
      <li>Protocol Data Units (PDUs).</li>
      <li>GDP protocol.</li>
      <li>Event loop.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Generally speaking, the GDP library is structured as an event-driven
      program with a synchronous API.&nbsp; One thread services events (e.g.,
      responses from the GDP daemon) while the main thread executes the user
      application.&nbsp; When the application needs to contact the daemon, it
      sends the message and then waits on a condition variable until
      signaled.&nbsp; In the meantime, the event look will wait for a response,
      associate it with the appropriate GOB handle on the basis of the GOB
      associative cache, and then signal the application to collect the results.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Data is exchanged through a data structure of type <code>gdp_datum_t</code>,
      which contains a record number a time stamp, and a data buffer.&nbsp; When
      sending data to the GDP daemon, the application creates a datum, fills it
      in with data, and sends it to the daemon.&nbsp; When receiving data from
      the GDP daemon, the application passes a datum into the GDP library that
      will be filled in.&nbsp; Generally when sending data to the daemon the
      record number and time stamp are ignored and replaced with the real record
      number and timestamp after the write completes.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Important Data Types and Structures</h2>
    <h2>Module Details</h2>
    <h3>API</h3>
    <p>The API module (<code>gdp/gdp_api.c</code>) defines all the externally
      visible routines.&nbsp; Since these are already documented in the GDP
      Programmatic API document, suffice it to say that it does the
      "translation" between the internal protocol and the external API.&nbsp;
      Approximately speaking, it packages up parameters into a request, invokes
      the request, and translates the updated request into any return codes.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Request Management</h3>
    <p>Implemented in <code>gdp/gdp_req.c</code>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Internally the data flow is managed through a series of requests.&nbsp;
      In many cases there will be only one request active on a given GOB at a
      time, but this is not necessarily true, especially in the GDP daemon when
      handling subscriptions (each subscription is a separate request).&nbsp;
      Requests (potentially) have a pointer to a GOB handle, a pointer to a
      protocol data unit (in internal form; essentially a packet), the status
      code from the operation embodied in the request, and special information
      for use when processing subscriptions.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The internal routines are:<br>
    </p>

          </td>
          <td valign="top">Create a new request and fill it in with a GDP
            protocol command, GOB handle, I/O channel, and flags (passed in as

            request ID.<br>

          <td valign="top">Free the request and all associated resources such as
            the space for packet information.&nbsp; It also decrements the

          <td valign="top">Free all requests associated with a particular GOB
            handle.&nbsp; GOBs that have pending subscriptions will have one

            associated request on the list associated with that GOB
            handle.&nbsp; Note that request IDs need only be unique within a
            particular GOB handle.<br>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Datums</h3>
    <p>Implemented in <code>gdp/gdp_datum.c</code>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>As described above, a datum is the internal version of a GOB
      record.&nbsp; The routines, which are externally visible, are:<br>

          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    When sending data to the GDP, the application has to create a datum, get the
    buffer from that datum, and add the data to the buffer.&nbsp; When receiving
    data from the GDP, the application creates a datum, hands it in to the
    appropriate read API, and upon the return can access the data buffer with
    return data, the record number, and the timestamp.<br>
    <h3>GOB Associative Cache</h3>
    <p>Implemented in <code>gdp/gdp_gob_cache.c</code>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The primary purpose of the GOB Associative Cache is to allow quick
      association between a GOB name and the associated handle.&nbsp; When a
      packet is received that contains a GOB name, this delivers the handle that
      contains the necessary state information.<br>

            If the GOB includes a free function, that function is called (this
            is used by the GDP daemon).&nbsp; It then frees the memory allocated
            to the handle itself.<br>

    <h3>Protocol Data Units</h3>
    Implemented in <code>gdp/gdp_pdu.c</code>.<br>
    <br>
    Packets are marshalled and demarshalled in <code>gdp/gdp_pdu.c</code>.&nbsp;
    Each packet has the following fields (with the number of octets for the
    field):<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Protocol version (1).</li>
      <li>Time to live (in hops) (1).</li>
      <li>Reserved for future use (must be zero when sending, ignored on
        receive) (1).</li>
      <li>Command or Ack/Nak (1).</li>
      <li>Destination address (32).</li>
      <li>Source address (32).</li>
      <li>Request id (4).</li>
      <li>Signature algorithm (1).</li>
      <li>Signature length (in 32-bit words) (1).</li>
      <li>Length of optional header fields (in 32-bit words) (1).&nbsp; This
        indicates the number of 32-bit words between the data length and the
        data (exclusive).</li>
      <li>Flags (1).&nbsp; These indicate the presence of the optional fields.</li>
      <li>Length of data portion (4).</li>
      <li>Record number (8, optional).</li>
      <li>Sequence number (8, optional).</li>
      <li>Commit timestamp (16, optional).</li>
      <li>possible future extensions (variable length).</li>
      <li>Data (as indicated by the length field).</li>
      <li>Signature (as indicated by the signature length field).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One field is used to indicate both commands and acknowledgements/negative
      acknowledgements.&nbsp; See the comments in <code>gdp/gdp_pdu.h</code>
      for the details of those values.&nbsp; This is worth emphasizing: the
      command field in the protocol encodes both imperative commands (e.g.,
      "write this data") and responses ("that data was written" or "could not
      write that data").&nbsp; Both forms are described in the code as
      "commands", and even share a single dispatch table.<br>

    <p>The routines for handling packets are:</p>

    <h3>GDP Protocol</h3>
    <p>Implemented in <code>gdp/gdp_proto.c</code>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The basic model is that users (e.g., the API layer) create a request with
      <code>_gdp_req_new</code> which contains a command (what operation needs
      to be done), an optional PDU buffer, an optional pointer to a GOB handle
      on which to perform the operation, the connection on which to operate, and
      some flag bits.&nbsp; The PDU buffer in turn contains all the information
      to be passed to or from the service, including data, timestamps, record
      numbers, etc.&nbsp; For example, on read the PDU will contain the record
      number to be read, and the response will fill in the rest of the
      information.&nbsp; The client then calls <code>_gdp_invoke</code>,
      passing it the request.&nbsp; That routine in turn sends the request using
      <code>_gdp_req_send</code>, waits on the condition variable contained in
      the request to get the final return status, and returns that.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The sending part, implemented by <code>_gdp_req_send</code>, links the
      request to the requesting GOB (so it can be found when the reply
      eventually comes in), makes sure that the GOB name is in the associative
      name &rarr; handle cache, and sends the packet.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When the reply message eventually comes in, it triggers an event in the
      main I/O loop; that is handed to (another) thread for processing.&nbsp;
      This is done through the bufferevent interface, part of libevent2, which
      invokes callbacks when events happen on sockets (that is, it can be
      considered as having a similar functionality to <code>select</code>, or
      more accurately <code>kqueue</code> or <code>/dev/poll</code>).&nbsp;
      The primary callback used is <code>gdp_read_cb</code>.&nbsp; That routine
      allocates a new packet and reads a packet into that area.&nbsp; If the
      packet is incomplete (i.e., it hasn't all been read in) the packet is
      freed and the callback returns (it will be called again later when more of
      the packet is read).&nbsp; If the entire packet is available, it calls <code>_gdp_pdu_process</code>
      (indirectly, via the <code>process</code> field in the channel) to
      interpret it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>[The code currently has a non-functional #ifdef for <code>GDP_PDU_QUEUE</code>.&nbsp;
      This is for a future extension allowing the packet to be dropped into
      another queue for interpretation from a process in the thread pool so that
      the read thread can focus entirely on reading and handing off
      packets.&nbsp; This technique is already used in gdplogd, and will only be
      used in the client library if necessary for performance.]<br>
    </p>
    <p>PDU processing in <span style="font-family: monospace;">_gdp_pdu_process</span><code></code>
      involves finding the associated GOB, if available, and from that finding
      the associated request.&nbsp; If no request is found a new request is
      created; this is the case with spontaneous commands.&nbsp; There is some
      processing of datums to handle the case where a request had an existing
      datum that needs to be replaced with a new one (for example, a read
      request that passed in a datum with the record number and returns a datum
      with the associated timestamp and data; since the read API passes in the
      datum, there is some shuffling necessary with the underlying data buffers
      so that the caller can actually access the returned data).&nbsp; The
      request (now a response) is then passed to <code>_gdp_req_dispatch</code>
      for processing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Processing in <code>_gdp_req_dispatch</code> is done through a simple
      dispatch table indexed by command.&nbsp; Requests can be either commands
      or responses (ack/nak); in most cases, client programs should only receive
      responses, and will get a "not implemented" if any commands are
      received.&nbsp; Responses fall into 2&frac12; classes: successes (acks),
      client naks, and server naks.&nbsp; There are several of each of these,
      which roughly correspond to HTTP response codes (2xx, 4xx, and 5xx
      respectively) or CoAP codes (2.xx, 4.xx, and 5.xx).&nbsp; These piggyback
      on three routines (<code>ack_success</code>, <code>nak_client</code>, and
      <code>nak_server</code>), the latter two of which are essentially
      identical, doing nothing but passing the error on up the stack.&nbsp; The
      <code> ack_success</code> routine checks for some nonsensical situations
      and passes the (interpreted) status back up to <span style="font-family: monospace;">_gdp_pdu_process</span><code></code>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The response from the command is then interpreted by <code>_gdp_pdu_process</code>.&nbsp;
      There are two cases.&nbsp; The simpler one is when the command/response
      was a simple ack/nak, in which case the status is stored in the request
      and the thread waiting on that request is poked to wake up.&nbsp; The
      other case is when the request is a subscription, in which case this
      request (which in this case must be a response) must be turned into an
      event.&nbsp; If so, a new event is created and passed off to the event
      subsystem for delivery (described elsewhere).<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Response Confusion</h4>
    <p>One major confusion results from the large variety of response codes from
      various existing subsystems.&nbsp; One common status encoding is HTTP
      status codes and CoAP status codes.&nbsp; These overlap (mostly), so we
      can (mostly) treat them as the same thing.&nbsp; They are the primary mode
      of passing protocol status in the GDP protocol, but since those response
      are only eight bits the codes are offset: HTTP/COAP codes 200&ndash;264
      become commands 128&ndash;191, codes 400&ndash;432 become commands
      192&ndash;223, and codes 500&ndash;531 become commands 224&ndash;254.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Internally the GDP library uses the <code>EP_STAT</code> abstraction as
      a status lingua franca.&nbsp; <code>EP_STAT</code>s allow encoding of
      response codes in a single integer (so they can be passed easily back from
      functions).&nbsp; Those integers encode a severity (most importantly,
      success or failure), a registry and a module identifier (which for this
      purpose can be treated as one piece), and detail information.&nbsp; The
      module is used to create broad categories: for example, one module
      corresponds to Unix errnos, allowing them to be passed back
      directly.&nbsp; Another module is specific to the GDP.&nbsp; There are
      several generic status codes defined in <code>gdp/gdp_stat.h</code> such
      as <code>GDP_STAT_KEEP_READING</code> (a warning that a partial packet
      has been read but the remainder remains to be read) or <code>GDP_STAT_CORRUPT_GOB</code>
      (a severe error saying that the disk representation of a GOB is corrupt
      and cannot be read).&nbsp; The HTTP/CoAP codes are encoded in the same
      module, but back in their original positions, i.e., in the 200&ndash;599
      range.<br>

    <h3>Event Processing</h3>
    <p>Events (see <code>gdp/gdp_event.c</code>) are a way of delivering
      information to a client without using an RPC-style blocking
      response.&nbsp; Specifically, a client can issue several commands and then
      wait for the responses to come in an arbitrary order.&nbsp; The
      implementation is simple: as messages are read that cannot be immediately
      processed they are turned into events.&nbsp; Those events are linked onto
      an active list.&nbsp; The client can collect events using <code>gdp_event_next</code>,
      which takes them off the active queue.&nbsp; The client is responsible for
      freeing them using <code>gdp_event_free</code>.<br>
