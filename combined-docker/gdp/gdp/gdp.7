.Os Swwarm-GDP
.Sh NAME
.Nm GDP
.Nd the Global Data Plane
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This description is an introduction to the existing GDP implementation.
It is not intended as an introduction to the GDP itself.
For that, start at
.UR https://gdp.cs.berkeley.edu/redmine/projects/gdp
https://gdp.cs.berkeley.edu/redmine/projects/gdp.
.UE
.Pp
The Global Data Plane consists of two major components:
the routing layer transfers data using internal, flat namespace addresses,
and the storage layer manages data modeled on
append-only, immutable, record-based logs.
.Pp
A major goal of the GDP is to ensure that clients can validate
that all data are true
using cryptographic techniques.
The primary tools used are public key cryptography
and Merkle trees.
This is based on the fundamental premise that,
if you know the name of a data object,
you can verify that the contents of the object are accurate,
even if the server on which that data have been stored is corrupt.
.
.Ss Data Model
Data are structured as opaque, append-only, record-based logs.
Opaque means that the system makes no attempt to parse or interpret
the data, i.e., each record is a blob
indexed by the hash of the contents,
with a
.Qq "record number"
index for human convenience.
The model allows for gaps and forks in the data stream.
.Pp
Names are globally unique, 256-bit names
that are cryptographic hashes of the log metadata,
from which the cryptographic proof of the provenance
of the log data can itself be demonstrated.
See below for more detail.
.Pp
More generally, the GDP deals with
.Qq "GDP Objects"
(or
.Qq "GOBs" ) ,
since other objects such as services share this namespace.
Logs are part of this namespace,
but it also includes log servers,
helper services,
routing nodes,
and potentially other actors.
.
.Ss Naming
GOBs are named using a globally unique 256-bit name
known as a
.Qq GDPname
that is typically
a SHA-256 hash of the metadata associated with the object.
Metadata always contains the public half of a keypair held by the creator
(other information is included in the metadata
to ensure uniqueness even if the keypair is shared).
The metadata includes the public half of a public-secret keypair
that is used to validate the contents of the GOB.
Any application knowing the internal name of a GOB
can validate that the metadata
and then use the public key from that metadata
to validate the data itself.
.Pp
In many cases,
GOBs have an external (human-oriented) name associated with them.
The mapping from the human name to the internal name
is saved in the Human-Oriented to GDPname Directory (HONGD).
At the moment all names (internal and human)
must be globally unique
(we may relax the rules for human-oriented names
when we create true name spaces,
but we expect GDPnames to remain unique).
.Pp
To make it easier to use globally unique human-oriented names,
users can set the
.Ev GDP_NAME_ROOT
environment variable as a primitive
.Qq "name space" .
For example, if that variable is set to
.Qq edu.berkeley.eecs.eric ,
attempts to access
.Qq demo
will try to look up
.Qq edu.berkeley.eecs.eric.demo .
Names already containing dots will be tried without modification
before this modification is attempted.
It is strongly recommended that GDP users set this variable
in their system startup files
to avoid conflicts.
By convention, the reversed domain name and user name
are used for this purpose, as demonstrated in the above example.
.
.Sh ADMINISTRATIVE PARAMETERS
There are several administrative parameters that can be used to tune
various parts of the GDP and associated support code.
Most of these should not need to be modified.
.Pp
Only parameters applying to multiple programs are documented here.
.Ss Syntax and Location
Administrative parameters are located in files located by a search path
that can be set using the
.Ev EP_PARAM_PATH
environment variable, giving a colon-separated list of directories
in which to search for configuration files.
This defaults to
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\&.gdp/params
\&.ep_adm_params
~/.gdp/params
~/.ep_adm_params
/usr/local/etc/gdp/params
/usr/local/etc/ep_adm_params
/etc/gdp/params
/etc/ep_adm_params
.Ed
The
.Qq ep_adm_params
options are historic and may go away in the future.
Best practice is to link
.Pa /etc/ep_adm_params
to
.Pa /etc/gdp/params .
.Pp
When a GDP program starts up it searches for
files named
.Pa default ,
.Pa gdp ,
and the name of the program itself.
Some programs may choose to search other names.
The first file of a given name that is found in the search path is read,
and all the different names are read,
so at most one file named
.Pa default
will be read, followed by at most file named
.Pa gdp ,
and so forth.
When parameters are found in more than one of these configuration files,
the last definition wins.
.Pp
Each file is a sequence of definitions, one per line, in the form
.Va name
.Li =
.Ar value .
Blank lines and lines beginning with a hash mark
.Sq ( # )
are ignored.
.Ss Generic Support Library Parameters
The GDP code uses libep, a general-purpose support library
that is not specifically associated with the GDP.
.Bl -tag
.
.It libep.assert.maxfailures
If at least this number of assertion failures occur,
the process will abort,
even if the assertion has a recovery action.
If zero, non-fatal assertions will never abort.
If one, all assertions are fatal.
Defaults to 100.
.
.It libep.assert.resetinterval
The assertion count is set to zero after this time interval (in milliseconds).
Defaults to 2000 (two seconds).
.
.It libep.crypto.dev
If set, try to use the hardware crypto acceleration provided by
.Pa /dev/crypto .
Defaults to
.Li true .
See
.Xr crypto 4
for more information.
.
.It libep.dbg.file
Where to write debugging output.
Values may be
.Qq stderr ,
.Qq stdout ,
or a writable file.
Defaults to
.Qq stderr .
.
.It libep.log.facility
The
.Xr syslog 3
facility to which to write log messages.
This is only consulted if a message is logged before the library
has initialized.
By default no logging is done.
.It libep.thr.mutex.type
The type of mutex to use for thread synchronization.
May be
.Li default ,
.Li normal ,
.Li errorcheck ,
or
.Li recursive .
Generally only used for debugging.
Defaults to
.Qq default .
.
.It libep.thr.pool.max_workers
.ns
.
.It libep.thr.pool.min_workers
When a thread pool is created, the application can specify
the minimum and maximum number of threads in the pool.
The minimum number of threads are created when the pool is initialized.
If more work comes in than there are available worker threads,
the pool may be expanded up to the maximum.
If the application doesn't choose these values,
these parameters come into play.
They default to one initial thread
and up two twice the number of CPU cores that are available.
.
.It libep.time.accuracy
In the libep world,
times are allowed to include an estimate of accuracy.
For example, systems with a high quality GPS clock
might have an accuracy under a microsecond,
while systems with a sloppy clock and no clock synchronization
might have an accuracy of multiple minutes.
If this parameter is set
it is used as the default accuracy;
if not set the accuracy is set to 0.0 which means
.Qq unknown
(not
.Qq perfect ) .
This is a floating point value, so decimal points and exponents are allowed.
The units are seconds.
.El
.Ss Parameters Applying to All GDP Programs
When the GDP library is initialized several parameters come into play.
These apply to all programs using the GDP library.
.Bl -tag
.
.It swarm.gdp.cache.fd.headroom
When aging out the log cache,
this is the number of file descriptors that must be available
(i.e., not open)
after a pass through the cache.
If fewer file descriptors are available,
the maximum age of a cache entry is reduced by 25%
and the cache is swept again.
For example,
if the maximum cache age is five minutes (300 seconds),
but after clearing the cache there are still fewer than
headroom
available file descriptors available,
the cache is swept again with a 3.75 minute (225 seconds) maximum age.
The default is half the per-process maximum number of open files.
.
.It swarm.gdp.cache.reclaim.maxgobs
Limit the number of GOBs to be examined during a reclaim operation.
This is intended for debugging (to detect loops in the usage time list).
If the number of GOBs in the cache exceed this number
an assertion failure will be thrown.
Defaults to
.Li 100000 .
.
.It swarm.gdp.catch.sigint
Arranges to catch the
.Li SIGINT
(Keyboard Interrupt)
signal and exit cleanly.
Defaults to
.Li true .
You might want to set this to
.Li false
in some debugging contexts.
.
.It swarm.gdp.catch.sigterm
Arranges to catch the
.Li SIGTERM
(Soft Termination)
signal and exit cleanly.
Defaults to
.Li true .
You might want to set this to
.Li false
in some debugging contexts.
.
.It swarm.gdp.command.runinthread
Run command processing (read, append, etc.) in a thread.
Mostly relevant to
gdplogd .
Defaults to
.Li true .
.
.It swarm.gdp.create.service (deprecated)

Only checked if
.Va swarm.gdp.creation-service.name
is not set.
.
.It swarm.gdp.creation-service.name
The name of the creation service to use
for creating a new GDP Object.
Defaults to
.Dq edu.berkeley.eecs.gdp.service.creation
unless overridden by setting the
.Dv GDP_DEFAULT_CREATION_SERVICE
compile-time macro to a local value when compiling the code.
.
.It swarm.gdp.crypto.dsa.keylen
When creating a new key of type DSA,
the default number of bits to use.
Defaults to 2048.
.
.It swarm.gdp.crypto.ec.curve
When creating a new key of type EC (Elliptic Curve),
the name of the curve to use.
Defaults to
.Qq sect283r1 .
.
.It swarm.gdp.crypto.hash.alg
When creating a new log,
use this as the hash (message digest) algorithm.
Defaults to
.Qq sha256 .
.
.It swarm.gdp.crypto.key.dir
When creating a new secret key,
write it to this directory.
Defaults to
.Qq KEYS .
.
.It swarm.gdp.crypto.key.exclusive
If set, create secret key files using exclusive mode,
i.e., refuse to overwrite existing files.
Defaults to
.Li true .
.
.It swarm.gdp.crypto.key.mode
The file mode to use when creating a secret key file.
Defaults to
.Li 0400 .
.
.It swarm.gdp.crypto.key.path
When reading an existing secret key,
This is the path used to search for it.
Defaults to
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\&.

/usr/local/etc/swarm/gdp/keys
/etc/gdp/keys
/etc/swarm/gdp/keys
.Ed
.
.It swarm.gdp.crypto.keyenc.alg
When creating a secret key,
encrypt it using this (symmetric) algorithm before writing it to a disk file.
Defaults to
.Qq aes192 .
.
.It swarm.gdp.crypto.rsa.keyexp
When creating an RSA key,
use this as the key exponent.
Defaults to 3.
.
.It swarm.gdp.crypto.rsa.keylen
When creating an RSA key,
make it this many bits long.
Defaults to 2048.
.
.It swarm.gdp.crypto.sign.alg
When creating a new log,
use this as the signing algorithm.
Defaults to
.Qq ec .
.
.It swarm.gdp.data.root
The root of file system tree holding persistent data.
Defaults to
.Qq /var/swarm/gdp .
.
.It swarm.gdp.debug.assert.allabort
If set, assertions cause an immediate abort of the process.
If not set, assertions may attempt a recovery action.
Defaults to
.Li false .
.
.It swarm.gdp.event.loopdelay
If the internal event loop terminates,
sleep this many microseconds before restarting the loop.
This is to avoid allowing a software bug to chew up 100% of a CPU.
Defaults to 1000 (one millisecond).
.
.It swarm.gdp.event.looptimeout
How many seconds to allow an event loop to run before restarting it.
This is only needed in some versions of the underlying event library.
Defaults to 30.
.
.It swarm.gdp.event.timeout.data
How many microseconds to wait for missing data
before delivering what is available to the application.
It is only relevant if the network reorders or drops data.
Defaults to 100000 (100 milliseconds).
.
.It swarm.gdp.event.timeout.done
How many microseconds to wait for missing data
before delivering what is available to the application
after an "end of results" has been delivered.
It is only relevant if the network reorders or drops data.
If this is too short it is possible that results will be dropped.
Defaults to 250000 (250 milliseconds).
.
.It swarm.gdp.ignore.sigpipe
If set, the
.Li SIGPIPE
signal is ignored,
which allows the application to reconnect to the router
if it goes away during a write.
Unfortunately this also applies to writes to other files,
including
.Va stdout ,
which allows applications to fail silently
unless the application checks the result of every write.
Since almost no programs check to see if
.Fn printf
succeeds, this can result in programs seeming to hang
if the consumer of a pipe goes away.
Defaults to
.Li false .
.
.It swarm.gdp.invoke.retries
When a GDP client is trying to invoke a service
(for example, accessing a log)
it sends a message through the routing layer to the log or service
it is trying to access.
If a response is not received in a timely fashion,
it will retry up to this many times.
Defaults to 3.
.
.It swarm.gdp.invoke.timeout
When a GDP client is trying to invoke a service
(for example, accessing a log)
it sends a message through the routing layer to the log or service
it is trying to access.
If it does not get a response in this many milliseconds
it will retry.
Defaults to 10000 (ten seconds).
.
.It swarm.gdp.hongd.backoff
The base number of milliseconds to sleep between attempts to access
the Human-Oriented Name to GDPname database.
This is scaled by an exponential function based on the number of tries.
For example, with the parameter set to one millisecond
(the default)
the back off is 1 msec, 2 msec, 4 msec, etc.
See also
.Va swarm.gdp.hongd.maxtries .
.
.It swarm.hongdb.maxtries
The maximum number of times to retry a HONGD lookup.
Defaults to 10.
See also
.Va swarm.gdp.hongd.backoff .
.
.It swarm.gdp.hongdb.database
The name of the database holding the mappings
from a human-oriented name to an internal GDPname.
Defaults to
.Li gdp_hongd
(human-oriented to GDPname directory).
.
.It swarm.gdp.hongdb.host
The DNS name of the host on which the database resides.
Currently no default; this must be set.
.
.It swarm.gdp.hongdb.maxconns
The maximum number of simultaneous connections
an application will make to the HONGD database.
This is only relevant in threaded applications.
Defaults to 3.
.
.It swarm.gdp.hongdb.passwd
The password for the database user
used to access the hongdb database.
Defaults to the empty string,
as appropriate for anonymous users.
Note that this is not the same as the password for the
GDP Creation Service,
which has rights to update the database as well as access it.
.
.It swarm.gdp.hongdb.table
The name of the table with the mappings.
Defaults to
.Li human_to_gdp .
.
.It swarm.gdp.hongdb.user
The name of the database user to do the update.
This user must have SELECT permission on the database
to do a name lookup
or INSERT permission
to add a new name.
Defaults to
.Li gdp_user .
.
.It swarm.gdp.reconnect.delay
If a GDP application (either client or server) loses contact with
the routing layer, it will sleep this number of milliseconds
before it tries to reconnect.
This is to keep from flooding routers that are trying to reboot.
Defaults to 1000 (one second).
.
.It swarm.gdp.response.runinthread
Run response processing (2xx, 4xx, etc) in a thread.
Defaults to
.Li false .
Caveat Emptor: This is untested.
.
.It swarm.gdp.routers
This is semicolon-delimited list of IP names or addresses
to search to find a GDP router.
Each entry can also take a port number preceeded by a colon.
This list is always searched from first to last.
For no particularly good reason, defaults to
.Qq 127.0.0.1:8007 .
.It swarm.gdp.runasuser
If the GDP program is invoked as root,
change to this user id.
If that user id is unknown, switch to
.Li 1:1
(generally
.Li daemon
on most systems).
If the parameter is not specified at all no special processing takes place.
Can be overridden on a per-program basis.
.
.It swarm.gdp.subscr.refresh
How often open subscriptions should be renewed (in seconds).
Subscriptions that are not renewed will eventually expire.
Defaults to one third of
.Va swarm.gdp.subscr.timeout .
Note that the
.Xr gdplogd 8
hosting the log decides how long a subscription lease will last,
so changing this may result in mysterious failures.
Note that this interacts with
.Va swarm.gdp.subscr.timeout
(see below).
.
.It swarm.gdp.subscr.timeout
How old a subscription can get before it is expired.
This is used by
.Xr gdplogd 8 .
If this is less than
.Va swarm.gdp.subscr.timeout
then subscriptions will expire before they have an opportunity
to be refreshed.
This should generally be at least three times the refresh interval.
Note that the timeout is enforced on the log server,
which may use different values for these parameters,
so changes to a client system should be coordinated with server systems.
Defaults to 180 (three minutes).
.
.It swarm.gdp.syslog.facility
The
.Xr syslogd 8
facility to which to send log messages.
Defaults to
.Li local4 .
.It swarm.gdp.tcp.nodelay
If set, the GDP attempts to set the
.Li TCP_NODELAY
flag on the connection to the routing layer.
This disables the Nagle algorithm,
and can improve performance if you are not doing big transfers.
Defaults to
.Li false .
.It swarm.gdp.zeroconf.domain
The domain used when doing Zeroconf searches.
Defaults to
.Li local .
.It swarm.gdp.zeroconf.enable
Enable use of the Zeroconf protocol.
Defaults to
.Li true .
.It swarm.gdp.zeroconf.proto
The protocol used when doing Zeroconf searches.
Defaults to
.Li _gdp._tcp .
.El
.Ss Parameters Settable on a Per-Application Basis
These parameters can be tuned for each application.
In all cases,
.Ar progname
is replaced by the name of the currently executing program
as determined by how it was invoked on the command line.
.Bl -tag
.Sm off
.It swarm. Ar progname No .gdpname
.Sm on
Forces the program to take on a 256-bit GDP address
represented by it's argument.
Should only be used by daemons, and then only rarely.
.Sm off
.It swarm. Ar progname No .syslog.facility
.Sm on
The
.Xr syslogd(8)
facility to which to send log messages generated by this program.
Overrides
.Va swarm.gdp.syslog.facility .
For example, if a configuration file reads:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
swarm.myapp.syslog.facility=local1
swarm.gdp.syslog.facility=local2
.Ed
.Pp
then the program named
.Qq myapp
will log to facility
.Li local1 ;
all other programs will log to facility
.Li local2 .
.Sm off
.It swarm. Ar progname No .runasuser
.Sm on
If the GDP program is invoked as root,
change to this user id.

.Va swarm.gdp.runasuser .
.El
.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.Bl -tag
.
.It GDP_NAME_ROOT
If set, the value of this environment variable
is prepended to names that do not have any dots in them.
This can be used to provide simplistic name spaces.
For example if
.Ev GDP_NAME_ROOT =
com.example.user, a lookup of
.Li foo
would actually look up
.Li com.example.user.foo .
A lookup of
.Li foo.bar
would check to see if
.Li foo.bar
exists; if it does not, it would try
.Li com.example.user.foo.bar .
