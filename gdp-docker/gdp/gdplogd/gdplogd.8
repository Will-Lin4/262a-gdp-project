.Sh NAME
.Nm gdplogd
.Nd GDP log server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm gdplogd
.Op Fl D Ar debug-spec
.Op Fl F
.Op Fl G Ar router-ip
.Op Fl n Ar n-workers
.Op Fl N Ar my-name
.Op Fl s Ar sig-strictness
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm gdplogd
serves up logs from stable storage,
accepting commands from clients.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag
.It Fl D Ar debug-spec
Turns on debugging flags using the libep-style format.
Useful only with the code in hand.
Implies
.Fl F .
.It Fl F
Runs the daemon in foreground.
At the moment the daemon always runs in foreground,
so this flag does nothing.
.It Fl G Ar router-ip
Contact the given IP address (which may be a DNS name)
to get a connection to the GDP routing layer.
This will be replaced by automatic discovery
(for example, using Zeroconf)
soon.
The address may have an optional port number after a colon.
If this is not specified,
the names listed in the
.Va swarm.gdp.routers
runtime administrative parameter
are searched.
See
.Xr gdp 7
for details.
.It Fl n Ar n-workers
Set the number of worker threads.
A more flexible way of setting these uses the
.Va libep.thr.pool.min_workers
and
.Va libep.thr.pool.max_workers
to set the minimum and maximum number of threads in the thread pool.
See
.Xr gdp 7
for details.
.It Fl N Ar my-name
Sets the name of this log daemon instance.
This is the same name used in the
.Xr gdp-create 8
command.
.Em The name must be unique in the GDP,
and hence will usually have a structured name such as
.Qq edu.berkeley.eecs.gdp-01.gdplogd .
.It Fl S Ar sig-strictness
Specifies how strict the daemon will be about enforcing signatures
on append (write) requests to logs.
It is only possible to make the checking stricter using this flag.
See the description of the
.Va swarm.gdplogd.crypto.strictness
parameter below for details.
This option is only intended to be used during a transition period;
it will go away in the future.
.El

.Sh EXIT STATUS
.
.Sh ADMINISTRATIVE PARAMETERS
These only describe the parameters specific to
.Nm .
See
.Xr gdp 7
for descriptions of shared parameters.
.Bl -tag
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.admin.output
Specify the location for output of administrative information.
This is intended to be used for management and visualization
of the system itself.
The values can be:
.Bl -tag -nested -compact -width 12m
.It stdout
Write to stdout.
.It stderr
Write to stderr.
.It syslog
Write to syslog.  The messages will be LOG_INFO priority.
.It N
(where N is an integer) Log to the file descriptor indicated.
.It filename
Append output to the named file.
.El
The information printed includes interesting events
(e.g., when logs are created) as well as optional probe results
(see below).
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.admin.probeintvl
If set to a positive integer,
this specifies the interval in seconds
at which gdplogd will output a summary of the known logs.
If zero or negative no summaries will be produced.
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.advertise.delay
The time in microseconds between advertisements.
This is to avoid flooding the network on startup
when there are many logs to advertise.
Defaults to 0 (no delay).
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.advertise.interval
The time in seconds before
.Nm
will renew its advertisements of known names.
If set to zero, advertisements will not be renewed.
Defaults to 300 seconds.
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.crypto.strictness
Specifies how strict the daemon will be about enforcing signatures
on append (write) requests to logs.
The value is a comma-separated string of words
from the set:
.Bl -tag -nested -compact -width 12m
.It Li Verify
If a signature exists on an append command
it must correctly verify.
.It Li Required
Signatures are required to exist on all append commands;
any unsigned commands are rejected.
.It Li Pubkey
Logs must have a public key associated with them.
If they do not,
attempts to open a file for writing will fail.
.El
Only the first character is actually tested, so
.Qq V,R
and
.Qq Verify,Required
are semantically the same.
This variable is only intended to be used during a transition period;
it will go away in the future.
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.ignore.sigpipe
If set, ignore the
.Li SIGPIPE
signal.
This allows
.Nm
to reconnect to the router if it gets a write error.
Defaults to
.Li false
on systems that allow the signal to be ignored on individual sockets,
.Li true
otherwise.
See also the
.Li swarm.gdp.ignore.sigpipe
parameter described in
.Xr gdp 7 .
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.log.dir
The directory in which physical logs are written.
It is relative to
.Li swarm.gdp.data.root
(see
.Xr gdp 7 ) .
Defaults to
.Qq Pa glogs .
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.gob.mode
The file mode to use when creating on-disk log files.
Defaults to 0600.
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.gdpname
Sets the name of this instance of
.Nm .
This is needed when using
.Xr gdp-create 8
to create a new log.
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.index.cachesize
The size (in entries) of the internal record offset cache.
This can be used to speed access to recently accessed records.
Defaults to 65536, which equals 1MiB.
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.reclaim.age
When an in-memory log reference count drops to zero
that log is a candidate for having resources
(such as memory and open file descriptors)
reclaimed.
However there is a high likelihood that the log will be referenced again soon,
so reclaimation is deferred for this parameter's value (in seconds).
Defaults to 300 (five minutes).
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.reclaim.interval
How often to scan the cached but unreferenced resources
that might be cleared (in seconds).
Defaults to 15.
This should generally be less than
.Va swarm.gdplogd.reclaim.age .
.It swarm.gdplogd.reclaim.inthread
If set, resource reclaiming is run in a worker thread
rather than in the main event loop.
Defaults to
.Li false.
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.sequencing.allowdups
Allows duplicate numbered records.
.Em "THIS PROBABLY DOESN'T DO WHAT YOU WANT!"
The old record with the same number will not be accessible.
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.sequencing.allowgaps
Allow gaps in record numbers.
This will likely confuse readers who try to read the record
that does not exist.
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.sqlite.log-posix-errors
Send any Posix errors to the system log.
May be useful for some debugging scenarios.
Default to
.Li false .
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.sqlite.log-sqlite-errors
Send any SQLite errors to the system log.
May be useful for some debugging scenarios.
Default to
.Li true .
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.sqlite.pragma.busy_timeout
Set the timeout when SQLite will retry to get a lock
if the initial attempt fails.
This might occur if some other process is trying to write the database
while
.Nm 
is trying to read,
or holds a read lock when
.Nm
wants to write.
Defaults to 20 milliseconds.
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.sqlite.pragma.cache_size
Set the SQLite cache size.
Defaults to the built-in SQLite default.
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.sqlite.pragma.journal_mode
Set the SQLite journalling mode.
May be
.Li DELETE ,
.Li TRUNCATE ,
.Li PERSIST ,
.Li MEMORY ,
.Li WAL ,
or
.Li OFF .
Defaults to
.Li TRUNCATE .
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.sqlite.pragma.journal_size_limit
Set the maximum size of the SQLite journal.
Defaults to the built-in SQLite default.
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.sqlite.pragma.locking_mode
Sets the file locking mode.
May be
.Li NORMAL
or
.Li EXCLUSIVE .
Defaults to
.Li EXCLUSIVE .
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.sqlite.pragma.synchronous
Specify the circumstances when SQLite will force pages to disk.
May be
.Li OFF ,
.Li NORMAL ,
.Li FULL ,
or
.Li EXTRA .
Defaults to
.Li NORMAL .
.
.It swarm.gdplogd.sqlite.pragma.temp_store
Indicate where temporary tables should be stored.
May be
.Li DEFAULT ,
.Li FILE ,
or
.Li MEMORY .
Defaults to the built-in SQLite default.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl S
flag is a horrible thing indeed.
.Pp
Subscription leases should be per-subscription
and negotiated between the clients and the log servers.
