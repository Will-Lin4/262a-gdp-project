This directory contains example code intended to be used to help
understand how to use the GDP.  In particular, machine-mon.c is a
program that will periodically sample some performance statistics
and log them as JSON to a GCL.  See also the programs gdp-reader
and gdp-writer in the apps directory.

If you have the Python bindings installed, see also lang/python/apps
for some examples (if you've done a Debian install these will be
in /usr/share/doc/gdp/examples).  In particular, there is a Python
version of machine-mon as machine-mon.py.
