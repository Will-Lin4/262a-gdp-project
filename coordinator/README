Usage
	Launch the example_coordinator first, then launch the example_client. The example_client program requires a json parameter file.

Lambda Images
	In the lambda_images directory, there is a file called lambda_table. In the local case, entries are structured as

		<computation_id>	<path_to_local_compute_lambda>		<path_to_local_aggregator_lambda>

	whereas in the aws case, these are structured as

		<computation_id>	<compute_lambda_name>		<aggregator_lambda_name>
